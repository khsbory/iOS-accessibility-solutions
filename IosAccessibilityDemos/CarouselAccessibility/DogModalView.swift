/**
 This modal view displays a gallery of images for the dog, and has a dark transparent background so that
 you can still see the content of the view below it. It is meant to be a full screen modal view,
 but it creates problems for VoiceOver because it isn't a view controller that is presented modally.
 Because it's simply a view that's added on top of everything else, and because it has a transparent background so the
 views behind are still visible, VoiceOver doesn't inherently know that the views behind it should no longer
 be accessible. So the user can still swipe to access those views behind it while this view is presented.
 This creates a confusing, bad experience, so we override `accessibilityViewIsModal` to indicate
 this view and its contents are the only thing on screen VoiceOver should currently care about.
