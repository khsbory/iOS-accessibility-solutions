/**
    The custom carousel accessibility element is a core part of this sample.
    It is illustrating a way in which we choose to tweak the accessibility experience in a unique and interesting way.
    If we leave the collection view as is, then the VoiceOver user has to swipe to the end of the carousel
    before they can reach either button or the data for the dogs, meaning that they will only ever be able to
    get to the data for the last dog in the carousel through swiping alone. We instead create this custom element,
    and make it an adjustable element that responds to `accessibilityIncrement` and `accessibilityDecrement`,
    so that when a user swipes from it, they swipe immediately to the favorite and gallery buttons, then on to the data,
    for the specific dog. In some ways, we've transformed the collection view into acting more like a picker.
